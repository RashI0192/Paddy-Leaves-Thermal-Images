# Paddy-Leaves-Thermal-Images

### Thermal Imaging
- Thermal cameras detect infrared radiation which is emitted by all objects based on their temperature. The camera then converts it into an image that uses color to represent different temperatures.
- blue, purple - cooler ... red orange white - warmer
- Examples : House : red/ orange areas mean the heat is escaping so a poorly insulated house whereas blue means heat entering
- In inflammation blood flow increases so  will appear as warmer (yellow, red) , while healthy tissue will show as cooler blue green areas.
  
 ## Domain Knowledge
- I have ensured that the information is generalized and easy to understand.
- Dataset is on paddy crops and visualises how diseases appear in thermal images.
- Healthier leaves tend to be cooler due to transpiration , though may varies across the leaf vein location.
- Bacteria Leaf Blight : areas withwilthing and drying leaves - reduced transpiration showing up as warmer colours and more patchy
- Blast( show up as white gray green lesions with dark borders on leaves). Show cooler temperatures due to fungal infection hindering leaf's activities.
- Leaf folder is when caterpillars fold the leaves and feed on the tissue inside, creating transparent streaks on the leaf. The feeding areas will look warmer and folded protions = cooler
- Leaf Sport - circular brown lessions - fungal diseases , temperature differences where the lesions are cooler than the surrounding healthy tissue
- Hispa- whitish membranous leaves, scraping of the leaf surface which causes streaks and damanged tissue patches. These damaaged areas may appear warmer
